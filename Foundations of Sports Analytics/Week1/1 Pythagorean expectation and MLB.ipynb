    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of MOOCs we aim to introduce participants to methods for analyzing sports data using Python. In this first MOOC we introduce some basic concepts. These can be broken down into three areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  How to code sports data so that you can apply statistical methods\n",
    "2. The use of statistical methods \n",
    "3. The interpretation of results\n",
    "\n",
    "As we go along we will introduce you to the concepts by analyzing data from different sports and generating results. Once you get the hang of how this works, you'll Pythagorean be able to do it for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first week, we're going to go through simple but powerful examples that introduce you to all three elements."

    "# The Pythagorean Expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pythagorean expectation is an idea devised by the famous baseball analyst, Bill James, but it can in fact be applied to any sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any sports league, teams win games by accumulating a higher total than  opponent. In baseball and cricket the relevant totals are runs, in basketball it is points, and in soccer and hockey it is goals (by \"hockey\" we mean here what the world outside of the US and Canada usually calls ice hockey, but in fact the same is true in field hockey).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pythagorean expectation can be described thus: in any season, the percentage of games won will be proportional to the square of total runs/points/goals scored by the team *squared* divided by the sum of total runs/points/goals scored by the team *squared* plus total runs/points/goals conceded by the team *squared*.\n",
    "\n",
    "or *wpc = T<sub>F</sub><sup>2</sup> / ( T<sub>F</sub><sup>2</sup> + T<sub>A</sub><sup>2</sup> )*\n",
    "\n",
    "Where T<sub>F</sub> is runs/points/goals scored and T<sub>A</sub> is runs/points/goals conceded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a concept which can help to explain not only why teams are successful, but also can be used as the basis for predicting results in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first week we are going to derive the Pythagorean expectation for five leagues in five different sports:\n",
    "\n",
    "Major League Baseball\n",
    "The English Premier League (soccer)\n",
    "The Indian Premier League (cricket)\n",
    "The National Basketball Association (NBA)\n",
    "The National Hockey League (NHL)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding the data\n",
    "\n",
    "To derive the Pythagorean Expectation we will need to manipulate the data, which is a core skill that we expect you to obtain from these MOOCs. However, for this first week, we move quite quickly through the code, since our main objective is to show you the kinds of analysis you will be able to produce once you master Python."

The ratio of the coefficient (coef) to the standard error is called the t statistic (t) and its value informs us about statistical significance. This is illustrated by the p-value (P > |t|) - this is the probability that we would observe the value .8770 by chance, if the true value were really zero. This probability here is 0.000 - (this is not exactly zero, but the table doesn't include enough decimal places to show this) which means we can confident it is not zero. By convention, it is usual to conclude that we cannot be confident that the value of the coefficient is not zero if the p-value is greater than .05\n",

This statistic tells you the percentage of variation in the y-variable (wpc) which can be accounted for by the variation in the x variables (pyth).
